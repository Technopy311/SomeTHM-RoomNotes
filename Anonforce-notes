Little note: I think this is the fastest 
machine to pwn, in all THM, even faster to pwn than blue.
I made the room without writeup or any scanner (appart of nmap)
in under 30 min.

anonymous ftp found, you have access to the entire machine

in the /notread/ directory
i found:
	- backup.pgp
	- private.asc

used gpg2john, to get a john compatible crack file of private.asc,
and then cracked the password

private.asc:xbox360

Imported the gpg key:
$ gpg --import private.asc

and then decryted the backup.pgp
$ gpg --decrypt backup.pgp

the backup file, was the /etc/shadow file,
so we have the hashed passwords of 
root, and the user melodias:
	
	root:$6$07nYFaYf$F4VMaegmz7dKjsTukBLh6cP01iMmL7CiQDt1ycIm6a.bsOIBp0DwXVb9XI2EtULXJzBtaMZMNd2tV4uob5RVM0
	melodias:$1$xDhc6S6G$IQHUW5ZtMkBQ5pUMjEQtL1

now im using john to crack the passwords:

root:hikari
melodias:UNKONW

Either way, ssh with root, is enabled, so we are root now.
